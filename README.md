# TFA-CVD-model
Macrosimulation comparative assessment model for CVD impact from TFA (trans fatty acids) reduction policies
Inputs (population, deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke and TFA intake according to sex and age groups) must be added to the "Baseline and counterfactual" folder and uncertainty intervals area calculated using the Ersatz add-on. The model considers 5-year intervals for variable inputs, from 15 to 85+ years.
Ersatz outputs must be copied from the add-on and pasted to the "CodeStochastic" folder (ordered by the "CODES" variable). 
Model outputs are displayed in the "Results" folder.
